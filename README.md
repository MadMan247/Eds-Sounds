# Eds-Sounds
I make a shitty but also beautiful Minecraft resource pack to share with friends


This will be Considered a Changelog for the files that I will be posting.

The general idea is that untill it says ".V1.0" it will have a large number of the sounds missing and will therefore be incomplete.

Keep in mind that i'm stupid, and steali- borrowing the files and file layouts from the minecraft directory, but somehow it still says 
that it's an older version of minecraft, and, Quite frankly, I don't care enough to fix it. It works; that's what matters. If I do find
out how to fix it one day, I will.

Changelog:

-V0.1.1
  Changed all of the ambient cave sounds, but still cannot figure out how to change all of them? there must be some that I do not know what they are called. most of the cave sounds have been replaced at the very least.
  Changed the thunder sounds, but not the rain sound
  Changed the Fire noise, and the ignition noise.
  changed all damage sound effects. (Player being hit, big fall and small fall.)
  changed the menu music.
  Changed all Villager noises.
  changed like 2 of the zombie noises
  -YOU NEED TO EXTRACT THE FOLDER SO THAT ONCE YOU CLICK ON IT YOU CAN SEE THE FILE NAMED "PACK.MCMETA"-
  
-V0.2.1
  Fixed the fire sound after realizing that it was sub-par.
  NETHER PORTAL SOUNDS!! Very cool.
  Finished zombie sounds
  Filled in the chicken's sounds
  Iron golem sounds
  The pig noises are all placeholders; not at all finished.
  IDK probably something else that I'm just not remembering.
  -STILL NEED TO EXTRACT. THAT, OR YOU NEED TO MOVE THE FOLDER STRUCTURE SO THAT YOU DON'T SEE THE "ED'S SOUNDS" FOLDER-
  
-V0.2.6
  Cloth, Ladder, Stone, and Wood walking sounds. there are other that will change in a sec.
  "Changed" calm1. Its just a bad cover now, really.
  Changed some of the ghast noises. not all. the steps were a pain in the ass so this is a small one.
