# Eds-Sounds
I make a shitty but also beautiful Minecraft resource pack to share with friends


This will be Considered a Changelog for the files that I will be posting.

The general idea is that untill it says ".V1.0" it will have a large number of the sounds missing and will therefore be incomplete.

Keep in mind that i'm stupid, and steali- borrowing the files and file layouts from the minecraft directory, but somehow it still says 
that it's an older version of minecraft, and, Quite frankly, I don't care enough to fix it. It works; that's what matters. If I do find
out how to fix it one day, I will.

Changelog:

-V0.1.1
  Changed all of the ambient cave sounds, but still cannot figure out how to change all of them? there must be some that I do not know what they are called. most of the cave sounds have been replaced at the very least.
  Changed the thunder sounds, but not the rain sound
  Changed the Fire noise, and the ignition noise.
  changed all damage sound effects. (Player being hit, big fall and small fall.)
  changed the menu music.
  Changed all Villager noises.
  changed like 2 of the zombie noises

-V0.2.1
  Fixed the fire sound after realizing that it was sub-par.
  NETHER PORTAL SOUNDS!! Very cool.
  Finished zombie sounds
  Filled in the chicken's sounds
  Iron golem sounds
  The pig noises are all placeholders; not at all finished.
  IDK probably something else that I'm just not remembering.

  "Changed" calm1. Its just a bad cover now, really.

-V.2.4
  It has come to my attention that I have the stupid syndrome, and have accidentally used "stereo" sounds instead of mono (my mic is mono but audacity must've thought otherwise). This means that all sounds that are played in minecraft use the sterio format, and have no depth to them, making them sound like absolute shit. This has hereby been revised and fixed, through the most paingul system ever. one at a time.
  not yet completed
