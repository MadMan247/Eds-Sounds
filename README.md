# Eds-Sounds
I make a shitty but also beautiful Minecraft resource pack to share with friends


This will be Considered a Changelog for the files that I will be posting.

The general idea is that untill it says ".V1.0" it will have a large number of the sounds missing and will therefore be incomplete.

Keep in mind that i'm stupid, and steali- borrowing the files and file layouts from the minecraft directory, but somehow it still says 
that it's an older version of minecraft, and, Quite frankly, I don't care enough to fix it. It works; that's what matters. If I do find
out how to fix it one day, I will.

Changelog:

-V0.1.1
  Changed all of the ambient cave sounds, but still cannot figure out how to change all of them? there must be some that I do not know what they are called. most of the cave sounds have been replaced at the very least.
  Changed the thunder sounds, but not the rain sound
  Changed the Fire noise, and the ignition noise.
  changed all damage sound effects. (Player being hit, big fall and small fall.)
  changed the menu music.
  Changed all Villager noises.
  changed like 2 of the zombie noises

  Fixed the fire sound after realizing that it was sub-par.
  NETHER PORTAL SOUNDS!! Very cool.

-V.3.1
  It has come to my attention that I have the stupid syndrome, and have accidentally used "stereo" sounds instead of mono (my mic is mono but audacity must've thought otherwise). This means that all sounds that are played in minecraft use the sterio format, and have no depth to them, making them sound like absolute shit. This has hereby been revised and fixed, through the most paingul system ever. one at a time.
  not yet completed
  
  Holy fuck. I slacked the fuck off so it took forever for this update to come out, But that dosen't mean that I did little on it. Or maybe I did. You can be the judge of that.
  Added the ghast "moans" but it's still not completed yet.
  Fixed ALL of the soundfiles (excluding some ambient and menu noises) by making them into Mono so that Minecraft can understand them as 3d.
  I Cried for hours on end after realizing that the pack that I was originally working on, 1.12, only had about 600 sounds for me to change, but now 1.14 has just a couple more at a comfortable 1,500.
  Reduce package size by removing unnecicarry sound files. It is only about 50 MB now.
  Added a few new songs that aren't that good, but'll get the job done.
  fixed some noises that weren't loud enough
  rain now exists
